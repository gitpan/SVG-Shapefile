SVG::Shapefile

This slightly mis-named module uses Geo::Shapelib and SVG.pm to generate statustical maps from shape files and matching Excel spreadsheets. It can be used without an excel spreadsheet to plot values in the shape file's .dbf , or just to convert a shapefile to SVG. (Thus its name)

Version 0.1 is rather rushed out and slim on tests, etc because it's been sitting on a hard drive since we wrote "Mapping Hacks" (http://mappinghacks.com/ ) in which it is featured...
